# Deadline

Insitux was developed with roblox-ts in mind, allowing for easy porting to roblox, and consequently, deadline.
Currently, the commandline it works with is still in "early" development, however its core functionality works.

shobfix is an environment and server wrapper for Insitux.
Insitux is a scripting language, which may access values from the shobfix environment.
