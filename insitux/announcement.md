# WE'RE DROPPING 0.21

For clarification: 0.21 means game versions 0.21.0 to 0.21.10 (and further) - 0.22 is 0.22.0, or the new version available under the roblox place "Deadline Development Branch".

When 0.22 started development we split our work up to separate updates related to features from ones related to content. The result has been that 0.21 has long overstayed its place, has become extremely clunky to work with, and deal with fixing issues for, which isn't helped by the fact we decided to make major changes to how the game feels in the next update. This led to an extremely long time spent in development for the feature update, rewriting many of the game's systems to be more consistent & reliable.

## Our Past Direction

The problem with old Deadline is that it's inaccessible for new players, buggy, and has little direction in its game design. This results in stuff like the movement system featuring a "vaulting" mechanic reliant on just jumping at things until you land on top of them, the completely useless radio feature, poorly implemented scripting API, forced-open chat while spawned in, and more fundamental issues like the lack of new mechanics stunting our growth as a game studio. We believe we can do far better than what we have presented in our released version so far.

Additionally, while we are grateful for the community's help with crowdfunding content, we're still unable to hire anyone full-time or even pay a decent salary for ourselves. Working on this game for much longer isn't going to be appealing if we can't change that; the people behind this project are still regular people, attending university and high school, and we have to grow.

As a result, we have changed our course and mindset in the past year.

## When the time comes

0.22's first part of development is nearly finished. Once the core game works as intended, we plan to stop working on 0.21 content, and start porting everything to the new version + working on progression to connect it all together.

# THE PLAN FOR 0.22

Below is the list of things we are changing in 0.22.

## Better gunplay

Running while reloading, vaulting, majorly improved suppression, reload cancelling and a more detailed weapon editor are just some of the things we did to make the game play better. The old versions of the game had a lot of pace stopping moments that made it feel clunkier, and not in a good way. Necessary changes around hit registration (which we hope to keep improving) and player replication were also made, and we hope to keep making use of new Roblox platform features to keep the game running faster and smoother than ever. We believe those things will make a big impact on you.

## New maps

In 2022, gravitydefier offered to join our team as a level designer. Since then we have managed to organize a large library of map props with the help of Viro, and so far we are planning to release 4 new maps in the next update. Tel Aviv offers a much better and much more detailed version of both Shipment and Claustrophobic, Afghanistan has been remade from scratch, Hong Kong is our first city map & we also plan to include a completely remade functional shooting range.

## Moving away from insurgents

The theme of unspecified middle-eastern blocky looking men in bandanas fighting Americans is not only out of style, but it also contradicts the logic of both teams getting access to extremely expensive modern equipment, and it forces us to stick to logic which in the grander sense of the game just doesn't make sense. The consistency of one team getting eastern weapons and the other western ones doesn't hold up when they fight in completely random areas, and especially when they are planned to receive custom clothing that may break this even further. As a result insurgents & security will be renamed, and both teams will have access to all weapons in the game.

## Progression

The mountain of content we've created is quickly lost on the player when they have access to all of it. The plan for the way progression will work is to have player and weapon levels based on experience. You can fight with any weapon to unlock another, but you will have to work with a single weapon to unlock content for it. Things like camo will also be based on the amount of kills you've gotten with a certain attachment.

We'll also introduce a logistics mechanic which in short will reward running simpler gun setups and prevent building overly complicated ones. We'll also introduce quests and an ingame currency. Last, we'd like to mention predemo versions of the game will have faster levelling to test progression & predemo players will get XP boosts in the 1.0 release.

## The future of our team

While we don't plan to release any more Roblox games, we plan to keep working on this one for a very long time.
