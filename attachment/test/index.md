The AK 74N is an assault rifle exclusive to the [Insurgents](https://duckduckgo.com) team.

# Overview

The AK-74N is an assault rifle, designed to be a counterpart to the M16 and subsequently the M4A1. It utilizes the lighter and faster 5.45x39mm ammunition. The AK-74 presents some decent stats compared to the M4, but though to the fact it can't change barrels, it can't get to the same Projectile Velocity.
Usage

The AK-74N is primarily used as a standard Assault Rifle, with most players running 30 to 60 round magazines to accommodate this purpose; however, some players may chose to use them with the RPK 16 95R Drum magazine or the Saiga 5.45 10R Magazine to be better fitted to an LMG and DMR, respectively.
